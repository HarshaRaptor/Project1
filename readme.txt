Thanks for trying out my second project.

"main.py" is the main file, that u have to run for the project the even work
"test.py" is just there for testing purposes and for comparing with the "main.py" for any bugs
"info.txt" is the file where all the user's input will be stored in order for you to review them later
"data.py" is a file created by me(not a module or library) which contain a class "Countries" which contains a list "countries_list" this list       contain all the country names in the world, to compare with the user's input to see if the information is REAL.
